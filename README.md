# ICWSM_2021_CoVaxxy_Demo

This is a repository for hosting images used in a reveal.js presentation. That presentation was given as part of the demonstration of the Observatory on Social Media's web-based dashboard, CoVaxxy, designed to visualize the potential relationship between COVID-19 vaccine adoption and online (mis)information. You can find the dashboard [here](https://osome.iu.edu/tools/covaxxy).
